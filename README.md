## Description

This is an example on how to set up building a docker image using the new Swift Static Linux SDK introduced along with Swift 6.0.

## TODOs

- TODO: use base docker image that already includes static Linux SDK, blocked by this issue: https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/issues/420
- TODO: swift-nio doesn't build because of the same issue
- TODO: don't clone SwiftFormat in docker build
